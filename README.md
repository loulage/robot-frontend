# Explore Mars!
Small project to test my frontend skills!
I also created a backend API to interact with this react project. :  https://github.com/loulage/robot-back

Steps to run this project:

1) Run npm i command
2) Run backend API locally (I used port 3333 for backend and 3000 to frontend)
3) Run npm start command
